# Portainer App Templates for LinuxServer.io Docker containers

These [Portainer App Templates](https://documentation.portainer.io/v2.0/settings/apps/) can be used to easily deploy [LinuxServer.io Docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/u/linuxserver/) with predefined settings.

The templates are based on data provided by the [LinuxServer.io GitHub repositories](https://github.com/linuxserver).

Please keep the following in mind.
* The templates are not supported by LinuxServer.io
* The templates are being generated so I cannot accept requests to add templates

Detailed information about installing and using the templates and more can be found [here](https://www.technorabilia.com/portainer-app-templates-for-linuxserver-io-docker-containers).
